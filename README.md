# Automatic-Music-Generation

In Natural Language Processing, we generally deal with classical languages consisting
of words which not only contain a superficial meaning but also an underlying sentiment.
But, here in this project instead of language having words we are going to deal with
music containing notes. Just as words have meanings, notes represent special sounds,
just as words have sentiments, music has tempo, just as words follow a particular
grammar, notes follow a particular rhythm, etc.

There exist many models to predict/generate words. But here we propose to design an
algorithm which generates Musical notes. These notes are represented in musical
instrument digital interface (MIDI) files. We will try to understand more about these MIDI
files and the data they hold and how we can retrieve it to make sense for human
understanding. Main objective here is to provide an algorithm which can be used to
generate musical notes using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), principally Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
